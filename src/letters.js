We had chai, and something to eat at cheddis. Now the question was who will pay. we played a game for that and finally all thanks to my luck that i eneded up paying for all of you. I also remember you becoming an aeroplane to show that you are from aero dept. Crazy first meeting. Already felt the Jahnavi energy.`,

Also that was the day you saw me spreading nutella over the bread or whatever it was. But that was so husband material. Imagine making an account for me on shadi.com and losing me to some random girl on the site. HAHAHA`,

Teamkart was the pivotal point of our love journey. Also maybe it was my dad jokes, or me casually making me the subject of roast. You tell me what was it or what was that timeline that you fell in love with me.`,

The fun things we did, ran over the highway, walked on railway track- all the way to hijli, sitting and talking on bay top, you lying by me in the garden infront of nehru meuseum. The way you held my hand. everytime you kept your hand over my chest, my heart started pumping at 2x speed. You putting your head over my chest and counting my heartbeats. I was already having some feeling for you by then, but was not sure what that meant in reality. I just chose to ignore all of them, cause i didnt want to lose that friendship atleast. We even video called each other after reaching our rooms, just to make sure that we are fine. That was too cuteeeeeee`,

God what is happening, am I dreaming. The movie, the food, the chit chats we had, everything was so amazing.`,
